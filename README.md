"# Mechatronics System 1" 

testing out feature branch


"Collaboration & File Policy” section:

Commit messages: short, present tense, explain what/why (e.g., “Add sensor init routine”).

Branching: create feature branches; open PRs for review; merge into main only when tested.

Frequency: commit small, logical chunks; push regularly.

Conflicts: resolve locally or via PR; never commit broken builds.

Arduino files: commit .ino and source; add a .gitignore for .vscode/, build/, etc.

MS Office files: okay to store; diffs aren’t readable—consider saving PDFs for review.
